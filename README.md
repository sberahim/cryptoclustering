In this challenge, youâ€™ll use your knowledge of Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

# Steps
  1. Load and preprocess the data.
  2. Scale the data using StandardScaler.
  3. Find the best value for k using the elbow method.
  4. Cluster cryptocurrencies with K-means using the original scaled data.
  5. Perform PCA to reduce the features to three principal components.
  6. Find the best value for k using the PCA data.
  7. Cluster cryptocurrencies with K-means using the PCA data.
  8. Visualize and compare the results using hvPlot.
